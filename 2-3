""" The strategy is to divide the design in to multiple parts
1- First we will print the spaces starting from left e.g.
0
-
--
---
---
--
-
0
2- Second is to print the asterisk after printing the space from first step.
The output will look something like this after completing step 1 and step 2.
As you guessed it before, we have to take minimum of i and j

3- Third is to print spaces again which is equivalent to 2 * abs(j-i) - 2
4- Fourth is to repeat step 2 again to print asterisk
